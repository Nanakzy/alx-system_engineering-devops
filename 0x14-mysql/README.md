This project contains tasks for learning how to configure MySQL for production.

Tasks To Complete
 0. Install MySQL

Install MySQL on your web-01 and web-02 servers.
The MySQL distribution must be 5.7.x.
Make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01 and web-02. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status.
 1. Let us in!

Create a MySQL user named holberton_user on both web-01 and web-02 with the host name set to localhost and the password projectcorrection280hbtn. This will allow us to access the replication status on both servers.
Make sure that holberton_user has permission to check the primary/replica status of your databases.
 2. If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes

Create a database named tyrell_corp.
Within the tyrell_corp database create a table named nexus6 and add at least one entry to it. This is needed for you to set up replication.
Make sure that holberton_user has SELECT permissions on your table so that we can check that the table exists and is not empty.
 3. Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?

The name of the new user should be replica_user, with the host name set to %, and can have whatever password youâ€™d like.
replica_user must have the appropriate permissions to replicate your primary MySQL server.
holberton_user will need SELECT privileges on the mysql.user table in order to check that replica_user was created with the correct permissions.
 4. Setup a Primary-Replica infrastructure using MySQL

MySQL primary must be hosted on web-01 - do not use the bind-address, just comment out this parameter
MySQL replica must be hosted on web-02.
Setup replication for the MySQL database named tyrell_corp.
4-mysql_configuration_primary should contain your MySQL primary configuration file (my.cnf or mysqld.cnf).
4-mysql_configuration_replica should contain your MySQL replica configuration file.
Once MySQL replication is setup, add a new record in your table via MySQL on web-01 and check if the record has been replicated in MySQL web-02. If you see it, it means your replication is working!
Make sure that UFW is allowing connections on port 3306 (default MySQL port) otherwise replication will not work.
 5. MySQL backup
5-mysql_backup contains a Bash script that generates a MySQL dump and creates a compressed archive out of it.

Requirements:
The MySQL dump must contain all your MySQL databases.
The MySQL dump must be named backup.sql.
The MySQL dump file has to be compressed to a tar.gz archive.
This archive must have the following name format: day-month-year.tar.gz.
The user to connect to the MySQL database must be root.
The Bash script accepts one argument that is the password used to connect to the MySQL database.
