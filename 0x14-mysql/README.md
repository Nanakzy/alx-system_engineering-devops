What is the main role of a database?
A database serves as a structured repository for storing, managing, and retrieving data. Its main role is to provide an efficient and organized way to store and access data, ensuring data integrity, security, and concurrency control.

What is a database replica?
A database replica is an exact copy of a database, created to improve fault tolerance, reliability, and performance. Replicas are synchronized with the primary database to ensure data consistency and availability.

What is the purpose of a database replica?
The purpose of a database replica is to enhance data availability, fault tolerance, and scalability. By distributing copies of the database across multiple nodes, replicas enable load balancing, failover mechanisms, and read scaling, improving overall system reliability and performance.

Why do database backups need to be stored in different physical locations?
Storing database backups in different physical locations reduces the risk of data loss due to catastrophic events such as natural disasters, fires, or hardware failures. By maintaining backups in diverse locations, organizations can ensure data redundancy and resilience against localized incidents.

What operation should you regularly perform to make sure that your database backup strategy actually works?
Regularly testing the database backup strategy is crucial to verify its effectiveness and reliability. This includes performing backup and restore tests, simulating disaster scenarios, and validating data integrity to ensure that backups can be successfully restored when needed.
